# Vishvena - UI/UX Designer Internship Assignment

This project is a static recreation of the **AI Solutions page** from [Vishvena](https://www.vishvena.com/ai-solutions), built as part of the internship assignment.  
The goal was to replicate the **UI design and layout** as closely as possible using static HTML, CSS, and assets.
